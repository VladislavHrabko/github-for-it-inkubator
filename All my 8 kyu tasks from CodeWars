First task

Messi goals function
Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:
LaLiga
Copa del Rey
Champions
Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.
Note: the input will always be valid.

Issue:
function goals (laLigaGoals, copaDelReyGoals, championsLeagueGoals) {
return laLigaGoals + copaDelReyGoals + championsLeagueGoals;
}

Second task

Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.

Issuue:  
function isPalindrome(x) {
  return x.toLowerCase() === x.toLowerCase().split('').reverse().join('') ? true : false;
}

Third task
You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.
Write a function to return the 3rd.
Note: only positive integers will be tested.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle

Issue:
function otherAngle(a, b) {
  return 180 - a - b;
}

Fourth task
When provided with a number between 0-9, return it in words.
Input :: 1
Output :: "One".
If your language supports it, try using a switch statement.

Issue:   
function switchItUp(number) {
return (number === 1) ? 'One' : (number === 2) ? "Two" : (number === 3) ? 'Three' :  (number === 4)
 ? 'Four' : (number === 5) ? 'Five' : (number === 6) ? 'Six' : (number === 7) ? 'Seven' : (number === 8) 
? 'Eight' : (number === 9) ? 'Nine' : 'Zero';
}

Fifth task
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.
Example:
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

Issue:
function removeEveryOther(arr){
var array = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 2) {
  array.push(arr[i]);
  }
  return array;
}

Task 6
Complete the function so that it finds the average of the three scores passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

Issue:
function getGrade (s1, s2, s3) {
  const average = (s1 + s2  + s3) / 3;
  switch (true) {
    case average < 60: 
    return 'F';
      case average >= 60 &&  average < 70: 
    return 'D';
      case average >= 70 &&  average < 80: 
    return 'C';
      case average >= 80 &&  average < 90: 
    return 'B';
      case average >= 90 &&  average <= 100: 
    return 'A';
      }
}

Task 7
Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: the length, width and height of the cuboid.
Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.

Issue: 
const Kata = {
  getVolumeOfCuboid(length, width, height) {
    return length * width * height;
  }
}

Task 8
Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.

Issue: 
function stringToArray(string){
return string.split(' ');
}

Task 9 
Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

Issue:
function between(a, b) {
  const array = [];
while (a <= b) {
  array.push(a++);
  }
  return array;
}


Task 10
Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.
E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.
If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.
The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers.
The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!


Issue:
function firstNonConsecutive (arr) {
  let first = arr[0];
  let next;
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if ((first + 1) !== arr[i]) {
      next = arr[i];
      break;
    }
    first ++;
  }
  return next !== undefined ? next : null;
}
Best solution:
function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; ++i) {
    if (arr[i] + 1 !== arr[i + 1]) {
      return arr[i + 1]
    }
  }
  return null
}


Task 11
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained (Read the notes for more detail about it)
Example
With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:
1 * (2 + 3) = 5
1 * 2 * 3 = 6
1 + 2 * 3 = 7
(1 + 2) * 3 = 9
So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.
Notes:
The numbers are always positive.
The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
You can use the same operation more than once.
It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
Repetition in numbers may occur .
You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.


Issue:
function expressionMatter(a, b, c) {
  let first = a * (b + c);
  let second = a * b * c;
  let third = a + b + c;
  let fourth = (a + b) * c;
  let array = [first, second, third, fourth];
array.sort((a, b) => b - a);
  return array[0];
}


Task 12
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
Names given are always valid strings.


Issue:
function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
//  if (name[0] == 'R' || name[0] == 'r') {
//    return name + " plays banjo";
//  } else {
//    return name + " does not play banjo";
//  }
// }
return (name[0] == 'R' || name[0] == 'r') 
? name + " plays banjo" 
: name + " does not play banjo";
}


Task 13
Messi's Goal Total
Use variables to find the sum of the goals Messi scored in 3 competitions
Information
Messi goal scoring statistics:
Competition	Goals
La Liga	43
Champions League	10
Copa del Rey	5
Task:
Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:
laLigaGoals
championsLeagueGoals
copaDelReyGoals
Create a fourth variable named totalGoals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year.

Issue:
var laLigaGoals = 43;
var championsLeagueGoals = 10;
var copaDelReyGoals = 5;
var totalGoals = laLigaGoals + championsLeagueGoals + copaDelReyGoals;


Task 14
The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. 
It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

Issue:
function sayHello(name) {
  return 'Hello, ' + name;
}


Task 15
In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

Issue:
function reverseList(list) {
return list.reverse();
}


Task 16
Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. 
For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

My Issue: 
function remove (string) {
var str = string.split('');
  if (str[str.length - 1] === '!') {
   str.pop();
  }
  return str.join('');
}
Best practice:
const remove = s => s.replace(/!$/, '');


Task 17
Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. 
We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

My Issue:
function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
  let answer = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arrayOfSheep.length; i++) {
    if (arrayOfSheep[i] === true) {
      answer++
    }
  }
  return answer;
}
Best practice:
function countSheeps(arrayOfSheeps) {
  return arrayOfSheeps.filter(Boolean).length;
}

Task 18
Write a function that returns a string in which firstname is swapped with last name.

My issue and best practice:
function nameShuffler(str){
  return str.split(' ').reverse().join(' ');
}
