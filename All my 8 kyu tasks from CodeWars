LaLiga
Copa del Rey
Champions
Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.
Note: the input will always be valid.

Issue:
function goals (laLigaGoals, copaDelReyGoals, championsLeagueGoals) {
return laLigaGoals + copaDelReyGoals + championsLeagueGoals;
}

Second task

Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.

Issuue:  
function isPalindrome(x) {
  return x.toLowerCase() === x.toLowerCase().split('').reverse().join('') ? true : false;
}

Third task
You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.
Write a function to return the 3rd.
Note: only positive integers will be tested.

Issue:
function otherAngle(a, b) {
  return 180 - a - b;
}

Fourth task
When provided with a number between 0-9, return it in words.
Input :: 1
Output :: "One".
If your language supports it, try using a switch statement.

Issue:   
function switchItUp(number) {
return (number === 1) ? 'One' : (number === 2) ? "Two" : (number === 3) ? 'Three' :  (number === 4)
 ? 'Four' : (number === 5) ? 'Five' : (number === 6) ? 'Six' : (number === 7) ? 'Seven' : (number === 8) 
? 'Eight' : (number === 9) ? 'Nine' : 'Zero';
}

Fifth task
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.
Example:
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

Issue:
function removeEveryOther(arr){
var array = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 2) {
  array.push(arr[i]);
  }
  return array;
}

Task 6
Complete the function so that it finds the average of the three scores passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

Issue:
function getGrade (s1, s2, s3) {
  const average = (s1 + s2  + s3) / 3;
  switch (true) {
    case average < 60: 
    return 'F';
      case average >= 60 &&  average < 70: 
    return 'D';
      case average >= 70 &&  average < 80: 
    return 'C';
      case average >= 80 &&  average < 90: 
    return 'B';
      case average >= 90 &&  average <= 100: 
    return 'A';
      }
}
