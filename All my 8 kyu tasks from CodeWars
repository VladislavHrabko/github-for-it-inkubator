}

function otherAngle(a, b) {
  return 180 - a - b;
}

Fourth task
When provided with a number between 0-9, return it in words.
Input :: 1
Output :: "One".
If your language supports it, try using a switch statement.

Issue:   
function switchItUp(number) {
return (number === 1) ? 'One' : (number === 2) ? "Two" : (number === 3) ? 'Three' :  (number === 4)
 ? 'Four' : (number === 5) ? 'Five' : (number === 6) ? 'Six' : (number === 7) ? 'Seven' : (number === 8) 
? 'Eight' : (number === 9) ? 'Nine' : 'Zero';
}

Fifth task
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.
Example:
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

Issue:
function removeEveryOther(arr){
var array = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 2) {
  array.push(arr[i]);
  }
  return array;
}
