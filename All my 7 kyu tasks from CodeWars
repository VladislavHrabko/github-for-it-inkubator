Task 1
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that
an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.
Examples:(Input --> Output)

Issue:
function findNextSquare(sq) {
  
  return (Math.sqrt(sq) % 1=== 0)? (Math.sqrt(sq) + 1) * (Math.sqrt(sq) + 1) : -1; 
}

Task 2
Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.
Examples (Input -> Output):
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "

Issue:
function doubleChar(str) {
  var total = '';
  for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    total += str[i] + str[i];
  }
return total;
}
