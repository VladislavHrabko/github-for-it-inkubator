Task 45:
For this challenge, you'll change the opacity of an animated element so it gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen.

In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the animation per the @keyframes rule.
Target the element with the id of ball and add the opacity property set to 0.1 at 50%, so the element fades as it moves to the right.

Issue:
 @keyframes fade {
    50% {
      left: 60%;
opacity: 0.1;
    }
  }
  
  Task 46:
  The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:

animation-iteration-count: 3;
In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to infinite.
To keep the ball bouncing on the right on a continuous loop, change the animation-iteration-count property to infinite.

Issue:
animation-iteration-count: infinite;

Task 47:
Here's one more continuous animation example with the animation-iteration-count property that uses the heart you designed in a previous challenge.

The one-second long heartbeat animation consists of two animated pieces. The heart elements (including the :before and :after pieces) are animated to change size using the transform property, and the background div is animated to change its color using the background property.
Keep the heart beating by adding the animation-iteration-count property for both the back class and the heart class and setting the value to infinite. The heart:before and heart:after selectors do not need any animation properties.
 Issue: 
 animation-iteration-count: infinite;
 
 Task 48:
 There are a variety of ways to alter the animation rates of similarly animated elements. So far, this has been achieved by applying an animation-iteration-count property and setting @keyframes rules.

To illustrate, the animation on the right consists of two stars that each decrease in size and opacity at the 20% mark in the @keyframes rule, which creates the twinkle animation. You can change the @keyframes rule for one of the elements so the stars twinkle at different rates.
Alter the animation rate for the element with the class name of star-1 by changing its @keyframes rule to 50%.
 
 Issue:
   @keyframes twinkle-1 {
    50% {
      transform: scale(0.5);
      opacity: 0.5;
    }
  }
 
 Task 49:
 In the previous challenge, you changed the animation rates for two similarly animated elements by altering their @keyframes rules. You can achieve the same goal by manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.

In the animation running in the code editor, there are three stars in the sky that twinkle at the same rate on a continuous loop. To make them twinkle at different rates, you can set the animation-duration property to different values for each element.
Set the animation-duration of the elements with the classes star-1, star-2, and star-3 to 1s, 0.9s, and 1.1s, respectively.

Issue: 
  .star-1 {
    margin-top: 15%;
    margin-left: 60%;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }

  .star-2 {
    margin-top: 25%;
    margin-left: 25%;
    animation-duration: 0.9s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }

  .star-3 {
    margin-top: 10%;
    margin-left: 50%;
    animation-duration: 1.1s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }
  
  Task 50:
  In CSS animations, the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.

There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is ease, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end. Other options include ease-out, which is quick in the beginning then slows down, ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end, or linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.
For the elements with id of ball1 and ball2, add an animation-timing-function property to each, and set #ball1 to linear, and #ball2 to ease-out. Notice the difference between how the elements move during the animation but end together, since they share the same animation-duration of 2 seconds.

Issue:
 #ball1 {
    left:27%;
animation-timing-function: linear;
  }
  #ball2 {
    left:56%;
animation-timing-function: ease-out;
  }
